# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description
A helpful map outlining the real bus stops on the MBTA line connecting MIT and Harvard campuses. 
This experiment renders a map on the web page, overlays real bus stop locations and adds animation to track a bus along the route.

## How to Run
Load the HTML file into a webpage. Click the button to track the movement of the bus along the route and watch each stop. Click anywhere on the map and drag to move around the map as needed. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Future iterations will utilize a live data feed from the MBTA website to track the current location and status of each bus along the route.
